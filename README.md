## Generating Derani Regular

The Derani Bold font is the original Derani font. The Regular weight is generated from it by following these steps in [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/):

1. <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> (select all glyphs)
2. <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+!</kbd> (change weight)
3. Type `-40`, select OK
4. <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+D</kbd> (correct direction)
5. <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+_</kbd> (round to int)
6. <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+S</kbd> (save as)
